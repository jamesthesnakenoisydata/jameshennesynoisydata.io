Sebastian is a biologist who recently started his PhD. 
His prior research career has not prepared him to do any software development or coding. 
But his new, data-intensive research topic means that he needs to learn more about how to code. 
While he despises Elsevier with passion and is a big fan of Open Access he does not yet know how to translate the principles of open to software. 
Additionally, as part of his PhD Sebastian needs to teach data analysis at his institution. 
For this he has been tasked with developing basic teaching materials.
