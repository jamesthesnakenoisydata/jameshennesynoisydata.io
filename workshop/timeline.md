# Timeline for the workshop day

The workshop starts in the morning and ends on the same day at 5.30pm. People
are welcome to continue hanging out afterwards.

The day starts with introductions and then we have time for three sessions of
90minutes each. It might make sense to break a 90m session into two 40minute
sessions with a short break between sessions.

In between there will be lunch and coffee breaks.
